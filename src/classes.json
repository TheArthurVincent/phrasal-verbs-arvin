Moreover, their personalities often differ, so observe their behavior and interests to distinguish one from the other. Spending quality time with them and actively engaging in conversations will make it easier to tease out their individual traits. As you get to know them better, you'll start to notice the little things that differentiate between them, as you draw out their distinct experiences. Remember, it's not always about their physical appearances, but the nuances that bring their unique personalities to light.",
